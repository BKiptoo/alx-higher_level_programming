## Introduction to Exceptions

In Python, an exception is an event that interrupts the normal flow of a program. When an exception is raised, the program's execution is halted, and Python searches for an appropriate exception handler.

In this section, we will cover the basics of exceptions, including how to raise and catch them.

## Common Exceptions

Python has a wide range of built-in exceptions to handle various types of errors. In this section, we will explore some of the most common exceptions, what they mean, and when they typically occur.

## Handling Exceptions

Handling exceptions is crucial for writing robust Python code. In this section, you will learn how to catch and handle exceptions gracefully, preventing your program from crashing when errors occur.

## Custom Exceptions

Sometimes, you may need to define your own custom exceptions to better manage your code. This section will explain how to create custom exceptions and why you might need them.

## Best Practices

To write clean and maintainable Python code, it's essential to follow best practices for exception handling. We'll discuss some of these best practices to help you write efficient and reliable code.
