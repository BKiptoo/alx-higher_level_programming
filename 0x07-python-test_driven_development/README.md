# Python Test-Driven Development (TDD) Project

Welcome to our Python Test-Driven Development project! This repository is a hands-on demonstration of the Test-Driven Development methodology, which emphasizes writing tests before implementing code. Whether you're new to TDD or looking to refine your skills, this project is a great way to learn by doing.

## Project Overview

In this project, we focus on the principles of Test-Driven Development (TDD) to build Python code. The TDD cycle typically involves three steps:

1. **Red**: Write a failing test case that describes the functionality you want to implement.
2. **Green**: Write the minimal code needed to make the test pass.
3. **Refactor**: Improve the code without changing its functionality, making sure the test still passes.

By following this cycle, we can ensure that our code is reliable, maintainable, and that it meets the requirements.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you'll need to clone this repository to your local machine. You should also have Python and your preferred package manager (e.g., pip) installed.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/your-username/python-tdd-project.git
cd python-tdd-project
